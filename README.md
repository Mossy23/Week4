    Hi, my name is Jo, and this website is a simple introduction to who I am.
    I enjoy spending time with my family and being involved in sports.
  </p>

  <p>
    This photo was taken at a baseball game, which is something that’s important
    to me because it represents teamwork, dedication, and having fun together.

  <p>
    I created this website to practice using HTML and CSS and to learn how styling
    can improve the overall look and feel of a webpage.
